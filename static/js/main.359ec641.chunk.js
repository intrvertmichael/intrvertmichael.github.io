Made with React Redux Firebase and Typescript.","description":"<img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/14wTbNneogwjba/giphy.gif\'/>   <h1>\u201cWhat Gets Measured Gets Improved\u201d <br/> Peter Drucker</h1> <h3> Problem </h3> <p> I noticed that there are days where I am having negative feelings and those are the only days I notice how I feel. Sometimes those feelings extend days or weeks but I don\u2019t have in mind how I feel or what\u2019s been going on to cause me to feel this way. I am just focused on the current or next thing that needs to be done and setting my feelings aside. </p> <img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/5hoj4DDNIrAhQQH6Ds/giphy.gif\'/> <h3> Potential Fix </h3> <p> Mood trackers keep a record of your daily mood to keep a daily check in of how you are feeling. They force you to think about how you feel at that point in time and reflect on the day with a clear perspective of what\u2019s going on at that point. </p> <img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/IGzjZ5ncQ7fVK/giphy.gif\'/> <h3> Features </h3> <p> I added the ability for anyone interested to be able to use this web app. You can use your google log in credentials and have your own saved account which will save your calendar. </p> <img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhmCmDzqV12kkwdW/giphy.gif\'/> <h3> Challenges </h3> <p> I first made the website in Javascript but was having some runtime errors once published that I was happening once new months were being added on. This was the perfect opportunity to learn and start using Typescript. So I remade the whole app from scratch as an opportunity to learn Typescript and the app came out better than the original having had the experience of the first. </p> <img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/uKwa2KiBA0rTy/giphy.gif\'/> <h3> Results </h3> <p> Keeping track of my mood has shown me some patterns that have helped me reflect and improve my daily life. Having a daily check in also gives an opportunity to use this mood tracker also as a journal where I can explain what are causing these feelings. When I jot down the feeling and why it is easy to look back at the exact date when important events have happened. I no longer say I saw a great movie a few weeks ago but I can tell you the exact date and what else happened on that day.</p>"},"1":{"id":1,"bgColor":"#A6C39E","textColor":"#597161","image":"./moodCalendar.png","title":"Markdown Tab","summary":"A chrome extension that opens an editable Markdown file that is synced between all chrome browsers that you are logged in to.","description":"<img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/dBZU8FFTCCgidM7kVJ/giphy.gif\'/> <h1> \\"Paper is to write things down that we need to remember. <br/> Our brains are used to think\\" <br/> Albert Einstein </h1> <h3> Problem </h3> <p> I don\u2019t have the greatest memory. I forget things very often. I am using my computer and I tell myself. Next time I go online I have to remember to go on Google Photos and download that picture to post on Instagram but by the time I get back on the computer since it was not important or my priority I forget. Or I save a few bookmarks they\u2019re all related to certain topic that I only need to keep in mind this week. I come back to them and I forgot why I saved each one. Stickies were made to be able to be quickly reminded of something. The issue with stickies is that they are easy to loose and not good for the environment with all the trash they produce. I could keep a digital sticky or use the reminders app but usually if I forget about the things I will forget to open those programs before just going along doing what I need to do. </p> <img src = \u2018 \u2018 /> <h3> Potential Fix </h3> <p> I needed something that I would crash with all the time, and what better place than in the browser. I am always online looking at things and I have seen that there are chrome extensions that open every time you open a new tab. This seems like the ideal spot to have something that you need to always see and have easily accessible. </p> <img src = \u2018 \u2018 /> <h3> Features </h3> <p> I made the Chrome Extension using React. You can add emojis or Task Lists. Uses google account to store preferences. </p> <img src = \u2018 \u2018 /> <h3> Challenges </h3> <p> I had never made a Chrome Extension so I had to figure out the process or creating a developer account and publishing to their Web Store. Once published users wanted me to add features so it had to be updated with custom colors and a new markdown parser that would allow me to add features such as task lists. </p> <img src = \u2018 \u2018 /> <h3> Results </h3> <p> I thought this was something only I would find useful but published it in order to feel like I made something official. Much to my surprise it has gotten a few users and has been rated well. People have made recommendations like I have made on other people\u2019s projects. That was a good feeling that made me feel proud and accomplished. Now the main place I keep any notes that I need to remember is Markdown Tab. wethere it\u2019s a todo list, a routine outline, an inspiring quote, or some links that I need easy access to. </p>"},"2":{"id":2,"bgColor":"#8888AF","textColor":"#2F2E51","image":"./moodCalendar.png","title":"Open Source","summary":"Coming Soon","description":"<img src=\'https://media.giphy.com/media/3ov9k1173PdfJWRsoE/giphy.gif\'/> <h1> Open Source </h1>"}}')},,,,function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(16)},,,,,function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var o=a(0),n=a.n(o),r=a(4),i=a.n(r),s=(a(10),a(11),function(){return n.a.createElement("div",{className:"about"},n.a.createElement("h1",null,"Michael Paguay"),n.a.createElement("p",null," Self taught programmer "),n.a.createElement("p",null," Traditionally educated Designer "),n.a.createElement("p",null," Experienced Educator "),n.a.createElement("h3",null," New York | Front End Dev.
